xx/xx/2016 - 0.4.2:
* Tesseract: orientation detection: Ignore errors printed by libleptonic
  on stderr (thanks to TeisD)
* Tesseract: Fix support of dev builds (thanks to Fjup)
* Libtesseract: Fix support of dev builds (thanks to Jakub Semer√°k)
* Tesseract: Use '--list-langs' to get the available languages instead of
  looking for the data directory (thanks to Bernhard Liebl)

06/04/2016 - 0.4.1:
* Disable 'libtesseract' with Tesseract <= 3.03. It tends to segfault.
  Libtesseract: Disable it with Tesseract <= 3.03. It tends to segfault.
  Note: the segfault may not actually be related to Libtesseract. It may be due to other things in Debian stable (jessie).
  Anyway, Paperwork cannot work on Debian stable because of that --> disabled just to be safe


13/03/2013 - 0.4.0:
* New module: 'libtesseract'. Use the C API of Tesseract for OCR.
  This module is more efficient and cleaner than the old 'tesseract' module
  (no more fork + exec + sh, less image manipulation, etc).
  Note that with this module the images are just loaded and uncompressed
  by Pillow. With 'tesseract', they were loaded, uncompressed, re-compressed
  and saved by Pillow, then be reloaded by Leptonica. So the results may
  vary slightly.
* Tesseract: Add support for Win32
* Tesseract: Fix orientation detection for version >= 3.04.01


0.3.1:
* tesseract.detect_orientation(): Use a temporary file instead of stdin
  to transmit the image to Tesseract. Tesseract 3.04 doesn't support
  stdin + "-psm 0" (regression ?)
* tesseract.detect_orientation(): Improve output parsing reliability
* optim: Avoid unnecessary convert to RGB and allow using image formats
  different from PNG
* TextBuilder + Cuneiform: add extra settings for Cuneiform
  (cuneiform_dotmatrix, cuneiform_fax=False, cuneiform_singlecolumn)


0.3.0:
* New API: pyocr.<tool>.can_detect_orientation() and
  pyocr.<tool>.detect_orientation()


0.2.4:
* Tesseract : add digit-only support
* Tesseract : add support for Tesseract subsets of layout analysis (-psm)


0.2.3:
* Strip the alpha channel from images before running the OCR. It's basically
  useless and can prevent the tool from working correctly.
* Make hOCR parsing more resistant (handle extra data around box positions)
* Fix: Take into account that new versions of Tesseract uses the file
  extension .hocr instead of .html


0.2.2:
* Fix Python 3 support
* Add support for Tesseract on Heroku


0.2.1:
* Make it possible to use 'import pyocr' instead of 'from pyocr import pyocr'.
  'from pyocr import pyocr' still works but is obsolete.
* Fix dependency list: depends on Pillow (it's untested with PIL)
* Fix pyocr.VERSION


0.2.0:
* Python 3.x support


0.1.2:
* Tesseract: Fix version parsing
* Tesseract: Fix Tesseract 3.02.01's hOCR format support


0.1.1:
* hOCR: Parse lines as well as words
* tesseract.get_available_languages() : Fix fedora support
* Fix UTF-8 support
