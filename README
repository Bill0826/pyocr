Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python.
That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

Python-tesseract is a wrapper for google's Tesseract-OCR
( http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ ). It can read all image types
supported by the Python Imaging Library, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff,
and others, whereas tesseract-ocr alone only supports tiff and bmp by default.
It also support bounding box data. Support for confidence estimates is planned
for future releases.

USAGE:
 > import Image
 > from tesseract import image_to_string
 > print image_to_string(Image.open('test.png'))
 > print image_to_string(Image.open('test-european.jpg'), lang='fra')

DEPENDENCIES:
* Python-tesseract requires python 2.5 or later.
* You will need the Python Imaging Library (PIL).  Under Debian/Ubuntu, this is
  the package "python-imaging".
* Install google tesseract-ocr from http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ .
  You must be able to invoke the tesseract command as "tesseract". If this
  isn't the case, for example because tesseract isn't in your PATH, you will
  have to change the "TESSERACT_CMD" variable at the top of 'tesseract.py'.
  Python-tesseract is tested with Tesseract >= 3.01 only.

INSTALLATION:
$ sudo python ./setup.py install

TESTS:
* Tests are made to be run with the latest versions of Tesseract. The first
  test verifies that you're using the expected version.
* Most tests simply call Tesseract using tesseract.py and compre the output
  to reference files:
  * test.png --> test.txt / test.box / ...
  * test-european.jpg --> test.txt / test.box / ...
  * ...
